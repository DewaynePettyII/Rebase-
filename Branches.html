<!-- Listing Branches: git branch, list all of the branches in your repository. This is synanymous with
git branch --list
git branch <branch>, create a new branch called <branch>. This does not check out the new branch. -->

    <!-- git branch -d <branch>, deletes the specific branch. This is a safe operation in that git
    prevents you from deleting the branch it has unmerged changes. -->

    <!-- git branch -D <branch>, force deletes the specific branch, even if it has unmerged changes. 
    This is the comman to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with
    a particular line if development. -->

    <!-- git branch -m <branch>, renames the current branch to <branch>. -->

    <!-- git branch -a, lists all remote branches. -->

    <!-- git checkout -b <branch>, the above example simultaneously creates and checks out. -->

    <!-- git checkout <branches>, is used to switch between branches. -->

    <!-- When collaborating with a team it is common to utilize remote repositories. These repositories mat be hosted and shared or they may be a collegue's local copy. Its remote repository will contain its own set of branches. In order to checkout a remote branch you have to first fetch the content of the branch.
    git fetch --all -->

    <!-- git merge <branch>, this command merges the specific branch into the current branch. -->

    <!-- Resolving conflict, if the two branches you are trying to merge both change the same part
        of the file, git won't be able to figure out which version to use. When such a certain situation occurs, it stops right before the merge commit so that you can resolve the 
        conflicts manually. And that's the great part of git's merging process is that it uses
        the familiar edit/stage/commit workflow to resolve merge conflicts. When you
        encounter a merge conflict, run the git status command shows you which files needs to be 
        resolved. -->
    
    <!-- a new change for Bob -->
    <!-- a new change for Alice -->
